       "'President Clinton , distinguished guests and my fellow citizens , the peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history , yet common in our country . With a simple oath , we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings . As I begin , I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation . And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace . I am honored and humbled to stand here , where so many of America \\' s leaders have come before me , and so many will follow . We have a place , all of us , in a long story -- a story we continue , but whose end we will not see . It is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old , a story of a slave - holding society that became a servant of freedom , the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess , to defend but not to conquer . It is the American story -- a story of flawed and fallible people , united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals . The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs , that everyone deserves a chance , that no insignificant person was ever born . Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws . And though our nation has sometimes halted , and sometimes delayed , we must follow no other course . Through much of the last century , America \\' s faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea . Now it is a seed upon the wind , taking root in many nations . Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country , it is the inborn hope of our humanity , an ideal we carry but do not own , a trust we bear and pass along . And even after nearly 225 years , we have a long way yet to travel . While many of our citizens prosper , others doubt the promise , even the justice , of our own country . The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth . And sometimes our differences run so deep , it seems we share a continent , but not a country . We do not accept this , and we will not allow it . Our unity , our union , is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation . And this is my solemn pledge : I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity . I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in His image . And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward . America has never been united by blood or birth or soil . We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds , lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens . Every child must be taught these principles . Every citizen must uphold them . And every immigrant , by embracing these ideals , makes our country more , not less , American . Today , we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation \\' s promise through civility , courage , compassion and character . America , at its best , matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility . A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect , fair dealing and forgiveness . Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because , in a time of peace , the stakes of our debates appear small . But the stakes for America are never small . If our country does not lead the cause of freedom , it will not be led . If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character , we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism . If we permit our economy to drift and decline , the vulnerable will suffer most . We must live up to the calling we share . Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment . It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism , of community over chaos . And this commitment , if we keep it , is a way to shared accomplishment . America , at its best , is also courageous . Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war , when defending common dangers defined our common good . Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us . We must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations . Together , we will reclaim America \\' s schools , before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives . We will reform Social Security and Medicare , sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent . And we will reduce taxes , to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans . We will build our defenses beyond challenge , lest weakness invite challenge . We will confront weapons of mass destruction , so that a new century is spared new horrors . The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake : America remains engaged in the world by history and by choice , shaping a balance of power that favors freedom . We will defend our allies and our interests . We will show purpose without arrogance . We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength . And to all nations , we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth . America , at its best , is compassionate . In the quiet of American conscience , we know that deep , persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation \\' s promise . And whatever our views of its cause , we can agree that children at risk are not at fault . Abandonment and abuse are not acts of God , they are failures of love . And the proliferation of prisons , however necessary , is no substitute for hope and order in our souls . Where there is suffering , there is duty . Americans in need are not strangers , they are citizens , not problems , but priorities . And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless . Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health , for civil rights and common schools . Yet compassion is the work of a nation , not just a government . And some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor \\' s touch or a pastor \\' s prayer . Church and charity , synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity , and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws . Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty , but we can listen to those who do . And I can pledge our nation to a goal : When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho , we will not pass to the other side . America , at its best , is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected . Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats , it is a call to conscience . And though it requires sacrifice , it brings a deeper fulfillment . We find the fullness of life not only in options , but in commitments . And we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free . Our public interest depends on private character , on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness , on uncounted , unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom . Sometimes in life we are called to do great things . But as a saint of our times has said , every day we are called to do small things with great love . The most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone . I will live and lead by these principles : to advance my convictions with civility , to pursue the public interest with courage , to speak for greater justice and compassion , to call for responsibility and try to live it as well . In all these ways , I will bring the values of our history to the care of our times . What you do is as important as anything government does . I ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort ; to defend needed reforms against easy attacks ; to serve your nation , beginning with your neighbor . I ask you to be citizens : citizens , not spectators ; citizens , not subjects ; responsible citizens , building communities of service and a nation of character . Americans are generous and strong and decent , not because we believe in ourselves , but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves . When this spirit of citizenship is missing , no government program can replace it . When this spirit is present , no wrong can stand against it . After the Declaration of Independence was signed , Virginia statesman John Page wrote to Thomas Jefferson : \" We know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong . Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm ?\" Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration . The years and changes accumulate . But the themes of this day he would know : our nation \\' s grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity . We are not this story \\' s author , who fills time and eternity with his purpose . Yet his purpose is achieved in our duty , and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another . Never tiring , never yielding , never finishing , we renew that purpose today , to make our country more just and generous , to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life . This work continues . This story goes on . And an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm . God bless you all , and God bless America .'"
